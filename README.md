# Tic-Tac-Toe_Game
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking spaces with their symbol, typically X and O, with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It's a simple yet engaging game often used to teach basic strategy and critical thinking skills.
